## user-stylesheet

This is my minimalist user stylesheet that removes all the crap I don't use from the internet.

### Installing on Chrome

1. Clone this repo. You can also fork and clone your own repo.
2. Install extension on google chrome
   1. Visit the extensions tab
   2. Select "Load unpacked extension..."
   3. Browse to "YOUR_CLONED_REPO/chrome-extension" and select
3. Compile the Custom.sass file and throw it in the Chrome's UserStylesheet directory.
   I like to do this: `sass Custom.sass > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css`
